### Project Description:
The project aims to analyze and cluster energy intake data to identify patterns and insights that can help in understanding dietary habits and their implications on health. Python is used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The main steps involved in the project include:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Importing necessary libraries like pandas and numpy.
   - Loading the dataset and handling missing values or inconsistencies.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics.
   - Descriptive statistics and visualizations to summarize the data.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance the analysis.
   - Normalizing or scaling the data to prepare it for clustering.

4. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - Applying clustering algorithms (such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group similar data points.
   - Determining the optimal number of clusters using methods like the elbow method or silhouette score.

5. **Results Interpretation:**
   - Analyzing the clusters to interpret the results and identify patterns or trends.
   - Visualizing the clusters using plots to aid in understanding the groupings.

6. **Conclusion and Insights:**
   - Summarizing the findings and their implications on dietary habits and health.
   - Discussing potential applications of the results in health research and policy-making.
